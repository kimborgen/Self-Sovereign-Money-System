# Thesis

Inspired by recent events in the financial system, primarily the run on Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) that caused its collapse, I wanted to analyse the current economic system and research improvements or alternatives. The initial problem statement:

> A 100% Reserve Banking (100RB) system can address the risks of bank runs and financial instability inherent in Fractional Reserve Banking (FRB) by requiring banks to hold the full amount of customer deposits as reserves. However, the challenge lies in implementing measures that promote economic growth and credit creation at the same level as in the FRB system without compromising financial stability.
> 

Digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies, tokens, and stablecoins, present a framework of 100% self-sovereign assets that may fulfil the primary requirements of 100RB but without a clear approach on how to promote economic growth and credit creation at the same level of FRB. A more specific problem statement can then be formulated.

> A 100% Reserve Banking (100RB) system using digital assets can address the risks of bank runs and financial instability inherent in Fractional Reserve Banking (FRB). Can we design a framework that utilizes digital assets to promote economic growth and credit creation at the same level as in the Fractional Reserve Banking system without compromising financial stability?

The specific initial idea can be explored below, but more research must be performed before the problem statement can be transformed into a specific idea.

## Initial idea draft

The following is a stream-of-consciousness for the purpose of recording/tracking the initial idea and nothing more:

- A token system that issues loans by simply minting new tokens. The debtors then pay back over time with interest. The interest goes to the loan issuers (+?), and the principal is burned to counteract the inflationary effect.
- Optionally, the token could also implement loans from time/term deposits, and savings account, with strict rules. So that you can opt-in to take on extra risk in exchange for profit (through interest).
- Issuing loans is a complex procedure. Creditworthiness and collateral must be established. The process must operate within the regulatory framework of the debtor's jurisdictions etc.
- The loan issuance process should go to banks or other qualified legal entities to perform necessary functions within their legal jurisdiction and economy. The alternative is to create a decentralized autonomous system, however, this would need to be thoroughly investigated.
- The process should be controlled and managed by the decentralized system. This system may perform the following functions:
    - Process and accept applications from qualified entities that want to use this system
    - Manage the limits, restrictions, and regulations that qualified entities must follow
    - Set default interest rate ranges(?)
    - Set the distribution and limits on loan types. Ex 30% business loans to green companies, 70% to personal mortgages.
- Given a sufficiently decentralized system, it gives the power to stakeholders to influence broad economic trends by incentivizing or requiring that new loans are issued to specific topics or industries. For example, requiring that 10% of all new loans are issued to companies working on fusion energy.
    - In the future, specific tokens can be made for specific topics so that the underlying value of the token represents a specific topic or industry only, but it's probably better to defer this idea until the project has matured and focus on a single system.
- This has the very nice benefit that the underlying value of the token is the economy itself and its ability to repay mortgages, business loans, etc. The value of this token may then track the broad economy very closely and may therefore become one of the most stable and risk-free assets we have → A stablecoin
- Central Bank Issued Currency (CBDC) has been criticized (as have other 100RB systems) for not enabling credit creation and economic growth. A CBDC based on this system (simply replacing the decentralized entity, with a centralized entity) allows the relevant central bank to issue digital assets that it controls while enabling credit creation and economic growth. This enables the central bank to control its currency and facility economic growth and stability.

## Background

All modern economies in the world rely on Fractional Reserve Banking (FRB). FRB is a system in which banks hold only a fraction of their customers' deposits as reserves and lend out the remaining funds to other customers. This system allows banks to serve as financial intermediaries between savers and borrowers, facilitating efficient capital allocation and promoting economic growth. In addition, fractional reserve banking enables banks to create new money through lending, expand the money supply, provide liquidity to the economy, and support payment services. However, this system also carries inherent risks, such as bank runs and financial instability, which necessitate the implementation of regulations and safeguards by central banks and authorities to maintain financial stability. 

(There are many many problems with FRB, expand on them here)

In contrast, a 100% Reserve Banking (100RB) system requires banks to hold the entire amount of their customers' deposits as reserves. In general, this means that banks cannot create new money through lending and act more like safe deposit institutions. The 100% reserve banking system can reduce the risk of bank runs and financial crises but may also constrain credit creation and economic growth. 

Several approaches towards a 100RB system exist:

- The Chicago Plan (RD-1, RD-2), developed by economists during the 1930s, proposes separating monetary and credit functions of the banking system by requiring 100% reserves for deposits and centralizing money issuance. This aims to reduce bank runs, financial crises, and inflation risks while allowing more effective monetary policy management. The plan's key features include a 100% reserve requirement, separating credit and money creation, and government control of money issuance. Critics argue that the plan may constrain credit creation and economic growth.  Fisher (RD-1) claimed the following advantages:
    1. Much better control of a major source of business cycle fluctuations, sudden
    increases and contractions of bank credit and of the supply of bank-created money.
    2. Complete elimination of bank runs. 
    3. Dramatic reduction of the (net) public debt.
    4. Dramatic reduction of private debt, as money creation no longer requires simultaneous
    debt creation.
- The Chicago Plan Revisited (RD-3) from 2012 revisits the idea within the modern economy of the US and finds support for all of Fisher's (RD-1) claims. Additionally, output gains approach 10%, and steady-state inflation can drop to zero.
- 2018 Swiss citizens’ (popular) initiative, ‘For crisis-safe money: Money creation by the National Bank only! (Sovereign Money Initiative)’ (RD-4). The initiative was defeated with 442k yes votes and 1379k no votes. The Federal Council and Parliament were against the initiative due to no precedent in any country for this type of system, a radical departure from the current system, which they claim to work well and has taken effective measures to improve financial stability, and that the national bank would receive an undesirable level of power.
- In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis in Iceland, a study on monetary and banking reform (RD-5) was commissioned in 2015 by the prime minister. A Sovereign Money System was strongly considered, but no further action was taken.
