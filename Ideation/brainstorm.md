The following is a stream-of-consciousness for the purpose of recording/tracking initial ideas and nothing more. No conclusions, quotes, or statements should be extracted from this section. If an idea is valid/applicable it will be worked on and transferred to another place in this thesis. 

- A token system that issues loans by simply minting new tokens. The debtors then pay back over time with interest. The interest goes to the loan issuers (+?), and the principal is burned to counteract the inflationary effect.
- Optionally, the token could also implement loans from time/term deposits and savings accounts with strict rules. So that you can opt-in to take on extra risk in exchange for profit (through interest).
- Issuing loans is a complex procedure. Creditworthiness and collateral must be established. The process must operate within the regulatory framework of the debtor's jurisdictions etc.
- The loan issuance process should go to banks or other qualified legal entities to perform necessary functions within their legal jurisdiction and economy. The alternative is to create a decentralized autonomous system. However, this would need to be thoroughly investigated. Only legal entities, such as banks, can legally secure repayments and in the majority of cases ensure that the loan pays for what was specified. Only legal entities will have access to sensitive information about aspiring debtors. These are some of the issues that require legal entities such as banks to be part of the system. Autonomous systems may be possible as the economy becomes more and more digitalized/decentralized and technical systems mature. A possibility is to create specific autonomous systems for very specific use cases that can be implemented decentralized.
- The process should be controlled and managed by the decentralized system. This system may perform the following functions:
    - Process and accept applications from qualified entities that want to use this system
    - Manage the limits, restrictions, and regulations that qualified entities must follow
    - Set default interest rate ranges(?)
    - Set the distribution and limits on loan types. Ex 30% business loans to green companies, 70% to personal mortgages.
- Given a sufficiently decentralized system, it gives the power to stakeholders to influence broad economic trends by incentivizing or requiring that new loans are issued to specific topics or industries. For example, requiring that 10% of all new loans are issued to companies working on fusion energy.
    - In the future, specific tokens can be made for specific topics so that the underlying value of the token represents a specific topic or industry only, but it's probably better to defer this idea until the project has matured and rather focus on a single system first.
- This has the very nice benefit that the underlying value of the token is the economy itself and its ability to repay mortgages, business loans, etc. The value of this token may then track the broad economy very closely and may therefore become one of the most stable and risk-free assets we have → A stablecoin.
- Central Bank Issued Currency (CBDC) has been criticized (as have other 100RB systems) for not enabling credit creation and economic growth. A CBDC based on this system (simply replacing the decentralized entity with a centralized entity) allows the relevant central bank to issue digital assets that it controls while enabling credit creation and economic growth. This enables the central bank to control its currency and facility economic growth and stability.
- The value of the token must be very stable at all times or in other words, it must be a stablecoin from day 0. If the value goes up, the debtor must spend more to exchange their working currency for this token, and this is not desirable. This has a much larger effect in the first stages of this system, where the token can probably not be used to pay for what the loan is for and is not the working currency of the debtors, which most likely is the debtor's national fiat. As time passes, the system will become more stable through diversification and more usage of the token directly, but at the start, it may require large capital reserves and liquid markets to remain stable.
    - Possible areas for research:
        - When the price of the token increases, defaults will increase, which will, in turn, decrease the value of the token. This may create balance.
        - When the price of the token decreases, it may make it more attractive to pay back more of the loan. This creates a deflationary effect that may end up creating balance.
        - Programmable interest rates can, for example, depend on the price. Making it more or less attractive to take up a new loan, repay existing loans, deposit more into time-locked contracts, or perform other functions in the system that may create balance and stability!
- Distributing this system over many economies, eventually, all countries in the world, will diversify the underlying value of the token and hence reduce the exposure to economic downturns in specific economics. The token's underlying value then becomes the world's entire economy. No other currency or investment asset can achieve this level of diversification and stability. A true world currency and economic system. → A word stablecoin
- This system may enable the creation of credit and economic growth in developing countries. 1.4 billion people remain unbanked ([https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2022/07/21/covid-19-boosted-the-adoption-of-digital-financial-services](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2022/07/21/covid-19-boosted-the-adoption-of-digital-financial-services)), and probably many more don’t have access to credit (source?). The system could enable qualified entities in these economies to issue loans with bigger risks and less or no collateral. However, this should probably be only a small part of the larger system to ensure the stability of the token, but still, this might result in massive economic growth of developing countries, reduce inequality, and contribute to many of the UNs Sustainable Development Goals.
- Working name: Economy StableCoin (ESC), Economy Digital Asset (EDA), Digitial Economy Asset (DEA), Economy Token (ET), Digital Economy Token (DET)… Credit or Loan should be part of the name. Credit Token (CT) - clashes with Crypto Twitter, Digital Credit Token (DCT), Loan Token (LT), Credit Economy Token (CET) - that's a timezone, Credit Asset Token (CAT) <3,  Loan Economy Token (LET). Because it's a working name and not a proper name (famous last words), I like the acronym CAT for obvious reasons, so CAT it is!
- Qualified entities could facilitate the exchange and take on the risk of short-term price fluctuations.
- Qualified entities must be legally bound to the decentralized system. How can the decentralized system perform legal action against a qualified entity?
- Voting power in the system must be sufficiently protected against short-term loans that increase voting power for a short time.

Inspired by recent events, for example, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank due to a bank run, I want to analyse the current economic system and research improvements or alternatives based on the digital asset economy and technology with the following initial problem statement:

A 100% Reserve Banking system, to which digital assets (may) belong, can address many of the critical issues in our current fractional reserve banking system by separating bank deposits from credit (loans). The main concern is that such a system could hinder credit creation and economic growth, leading to a lack of research. The question to consider is: How can a digital asset-based system facilitate credit creation, economic growth, and monetary stability at a level comparable to our existing fractional reserve banking system?

I will spend more time on the "why" by writing a preliminary research paper draft, but in addition, I want to create a prototype system as the final deliverable. Although it is better to wait, I can't resist coming up with an idea for the problem hehe, so my initial solution is the following:

Credit Asset Token (CAT 🦁). A decentralized system that replaces the role of a central bank with smart contracts. The system issues loans by minting tokens (and potentially using term-locked deposits). The minted principal is burned on repayment to mitigate inflation, and interest is distributed to the loan managers (and depositors). The underlying value of the token is the loan repayment schedule and the collateral for the loans, so low-risk loans such as personal mortgages and business loans are preferred. In this scenario, the token's underlying value is the economy itself. A fully decentralized autonomous loan management system on arbitrary use cases outside the scope of on-chain DeFi is probably not feasible. Qualified Legal Entities, such as banks, must take on the role of loan management within their legal jurisdiction, with strict constraints and legally bound to the rules of the CAT system.  It is critical that the value of the token remains stable at all times. For example, if the token's price goes up, the debtor must pay more for repayments, which is undesirable for the debtor. Automatic interest rate adjustment could be one of the tools to enable stability.

Some cool benefits of the idea
- The system can be distributed over many different economies, reducing the overall exposure risk to downturns of single economies and leading to global diversification.
- The management of the CAT system, for example, a CAT DAO, can determine arbitrary rules, for example, that 10% of all new loans over a year must be issued to companies within the fusion industry.
- Special interest should be put on including developing countries and those without access to financial services (still 1.4B unbanked), for example, by allowing higher risk and less (or none) collateral required on those loans. To ensure stability, it is probably best that this system is only a small part of the bigger system, but it may be more than enough to promote massive economic growth in those economies.
- The design of this system can probably be adapted to Central Bank Issued Currencies (CBDC).
- The endgame scenario: A truly global, stable, and permissionless digital asset backed by the world's entire economy that enables stable, sustainable, and fair economic growth.
**Blockers**: (Still in the ideation/research phase, started late Monday)
I would love some input on how to test the idea against financial models of real economies. Optimally a simulation-based tool that I could integrate into the testing suite.
