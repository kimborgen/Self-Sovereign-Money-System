The following is a stream-of-consciousness for the purpose of recording/tracking initial ideas and nothing more. No conclusions, quotes, or statements should be extracted from this section. If an idea is valid/applicable it will be worked on and transferred to another place in this thesis. 

- A token system that issues loans by simply minting new tokens. The debtors then pay back over time with interest. The interest goes to the loan issuers (+?), and the principal is burned to counteract the inflationary effect.
- Optionally, the token could also implement loans from time/term deposits and savings accounts with strict rules. So that you can opt-in to take on extra risk in exchange for profit (through interest).
- Issuing loans is a complex procedure. Creditworthiness and collateral must be established. The process must operate within the regulatory framework of the debtor's jurisdictions etc.
- The loan issuance process should go to banks or other qualified legal entities to perform necessary functions within their legal jurisdiction and economy. The alternative is to create a decentralized autonomous system. However, this would need to be thoroughly investigated. Only legal entities, such as banks, can legally secure repayments and in the majority of cases ensure that the loan pays for what was specified. Only legal entities will have access to sensitive information about aspiring debtors. These are some of the issues that require legal entities such as banks to be part of the system. Autonomous systems may be possible as the economy becomes more and more digitalized/decentralized and technical systems mature. A possibility is to create specific autonomous systems for very specific use cases that can be implemented decentralized.
- The process should be controlled and managed by the decentralized system. This system may perform the following functions:
    - Process and accept applications from qualified entities that want to use this system
    - Manage the limits, restrictions, and regulations that qualified entities must follow
    - Set default interest rate ranges(?)
    - Set the distribution and limits on loan types. Ex 30% business loans to green companies, 70% to personal mortgages.
- Given a sufficiently decentralized system, it gives the power to stakeholders to influence broad economic trends by incentivizing or requiring that new loans are issued to specific topics or industries. For example, requiring that 10% of all new loans are issued to companies working on fusion energy.
    - In the future, specific tokens can be made for specific topics so that the underlying value of the token represents a specific topic or industry only, but it's probably better to defer this idea until the project has matured and rather focus on a single system first.
- This has the very nice benefit that the underlying value of the token is the economy itself and its ability to repay mortgages, business loans, etc. The value of this token may then track the broad economy very closely and may therefore become one of the most stable and risk-free assets we have → A stablecoin.
- Central Bank Issued Currency (CBDC) has been criticized (as have other 100RB systems) for not enabling credit creation and economic growth. A CBDC based on this system (simply replacing the decentralized entity with a centralized entity) allows the relevant central bank to issue digital assets that it controls while enabling credit creation and economic growth. This enables the central bank to control its currency and facility economic growth and stability.
- The value of the token must be very stable at all times or in other words, it must be a stablecoin from day 0. If the value goes up, the debtor must spend more to exchange their working currency for this token, and this is not desirable. This has a much larger effect in the first stages of this system, where the token can probably not be used to pay for what the loan is for and is not the working currency of the debtors, which most likely is the debtor's national fiat. As time passes, the system will become more stable through diversification and more usage of the token directly, but at the start, it may require large capital reserves and liquid markets to remain stable.
    - Possible areas for research:
        - When the price of the token increases, defaults will increase, which will, in turn, decrease the value of the token. This may create balance.
        - When the price of the token decreases, it may make it more attractive to pay back more of the loan. This creates a deflationary effect that may end up creating balance.
        - Programmable interest rates can, for example, depend on the price. Making it more or less attractive to take up a new loan, repay existing loans, deposit more into time-locked contracts, or perform other functions in the system that may create balance and stability!
- Distributing this system over many economies, eventually, all countries in the world, will diversify the underlying value of the token and hence reduce the exposure to economic downturns in specific economics. The token's underlying value then becomes the world's entire economy. No other currency or investment asset can achieve this level of diversification and stability. A true world currency and economic system. → A word stablecoin
- This system may enable the creation of credit and economic growth in developing countries. 1.4 billion people remain unbanked ([https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2022/07/21/covid-19-boosted-the-adoption-of-digital-financial-services](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2022/07/21/covid-19-boosted-the-adoption-of-digital-financial-services)), and probably many more don’t have access to credit (source?). The system could enable qualified entities in these economies to issue loans with bigger risks and less or no collateral. However, this should probably be only a small part of the larger system to ensure the stability of the token, but still, this might result in massive economic growth of developing countries, reduce inequality, and contribute to many of the UNs Sustainable Development Goals.
- Working name: Economy StableCoin (ESC), Economy Digital Asset (EDA), Digitial Economy Asset (DEA), Economy Token (ET), Digital Economy Token (DET)… Credit or Loan should be part of the name. Credit Token (CT) - clashes with Crypto Twitter, Digital Credit Token (DCT), Loan Token (LT), Credit Economy Token (CET) - that's a timezone, Credit Asset Token (CAT) <3,  Loan Economy Token (LET). Because it's a working name and not a proper name (famous last words), I like the acronym CAT for obvious reasons, so CAT it is!
- Qualified entities could facilitate the exchange and take on the risk of short-term price fluctuations.
- Qualified entities must be legally bound to the decentralized system. How can the decentralized system perform legal action against a qualified entity?
- Voting power in the system must be sufficiently protected against short-term loans that increase voting power for a short time.

Inspired by recent events, for example, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank due to a bank run, I want to analyse the current economic system and research improvements or alternatives based on the digital asset economy and technology with the following initial problem statement:

A 100% Reserve Banking system, to which digital assets (may) belong, can address many of the critical issues in our current fractional reserve banking system by separating bank deposits from credit (loans). The main concern is that such a system could hinder credit creation and economic growth, leading to a lack of research. The question to consider is: How can a digital asset-based system facilitate credit creation, economic growth, and monetary stability at a level comparable to our existing fractional reserve banking system?

I will spend more time on the "why" by writing a preliminary research paper draft, but in addition, I want to create a prototype system as the final deliverable. Although it is better to wait, I can't resist coming up with an idea for the problem hehe, so my initial solution is the following:

Credit Asset Token (CAT 🦁). A decentralized system that replaces the role of a central bank with smart contracts. The system issues loans by minting tokens (and potentially using term-locked deposits). The minted principal is burned on repayment to mitigate inflation, and interest is distributed to the loan managers (and depositors). The underlying value of the token is the loan repayment schedule and the collateral for the loans, so low-risk loans such as personal mortgages and business loans are preferred. In this scenario, the token's underlying value is the economy itself. A fully decentralized autonomous loan management system on arbitrary use cases outside the scope of on-chain DeFi is probably not feasible. Qualified Legal Entities, such as banks, must take on the role of loan management within their legal jurisdiction, with strict constraints and legally bound to the rules of the CAT system.  It is critical that the value of the token remains stable at all times. For example, if the token's price goes up, the debtor must pay more for repayments, which is undesirable for the debtor. Automatic interest rate adjustment could be one of the tools to enable stability.

Some cool benefits of the idea
- The system can be distributed over many different economies, reducing the overall exposure risk to downturns of single economies and leading to global diversification.
- The management of the CAT system, for example, a CAT DAO, can determine arbitrary rules, for example, that 10% of all new loans over a year must be issued to companies within the fusion industry.
- Special interest should be put on including developing countries and those without access to financial services (still 1.4B unbanked), for example, by allowing higher risk and less (or none) collateral required on those loans. To ensure stability, it is probably best that this system is only a small part of the bigger system, but it may be more than enough to promote massive economic growth in those economies.
- The design of this system can probably be adapted to Central Bank Issued Currencies (CBDC).
- The endgame scenario: A truly global, stable, and permissionless digital asset backed by the world's entire economy that enables stable, sustainable, and fair economic growth.
**Blockers**: (Still in the ideation/research phase, started late Monday)
I would love some input on how to test the idea against financial models of real economies. Optimally a simulation-based tool that I could integrate into the testing suite.

- what tools do central bank have to control the economy?
    - Quantitativy Easing 
    - Interest on reserve 
    - ... 

- Central banks are called the lenders of last resort. But only to illiquid banks, not insolvent banks. In the start of a bank-run, for example cause by an illiquid bank reserve and no other underlying issue, the bank should be able to get an emergency loan from the CB to increase liquidity and everything goes back to normal. However if the bank is insolvent, due to bad investements and strategy, the CB does not want to give it a loan, and other measures are taken, such as selling the bank to a larger bank. If the bank in question is insolvent, the CB might give it a loan anyways to stop a domino effect.  If the bank is large enough, so called "to-big-to-fail", the CB might to anything to keep it alive, such as can be seen in the recent Credit Sussie Swizz.

- Deposit insurance is great, but the limit is only at 200 in the us and 250 in europe. While this is more than enough for majority of people, this limit also apply to businesses, which hold significantly more. 97\% of the deposits at SVB, a bank for small business and startups, was uninsured. The primary benefit of deposit insurance is to reduce FUD and increase confidence in the system, however since there effectivly is no insurance for businesses, the FUD increases. This causes business to deposit their money to the largest of instiutions where the risk of loosing their deposit is the least. Concentrating and centralizing money into a few extremly large banks. If one of these where to fail, the consequences would be disa. In the great recessions of 2008, the US governemnt stepped in took drastic measures such as lending to insolvent entites and other types of markets, taking ownership of companies, and in general bail-out the companies/banks in trouble. This has the consequence that banks know they are likly to be bailed out if the fuck up. Because there is a high probability of bailout, they can take on more risk and raise their profitability if their bets turn out positive and if their bets turn out negative the governemtn will bail them out. The term "privatizing profit and socializing losses". In the US the FED (CB) also act as the bank regulator to regulate this behaviour, however ....
Bailing out large banks and enteties makes sense, it is a relativly small price to pay to prevent systemic collapse. People(?) argue that banks and the financial system in geneak creates a very important function in the economy, so in the big generalized picture the cost of bailout vs the benefit of the economic system is massivly worth it. Decentralized Digital Assets DDA presents a system of decentralizing and automating these important functions that create massive benefit in the economic system. If these systems can perform the same important functions, then bailouts may no longer be necesarry. Or if they are still necesarry the bailout will benefit all not just management and shareholders of the bailed out institutions. 


- Shadow banks (Unregulated non-bank entites such as hedge funds, investement bans... outside the traditional banking system) lend out more money than the traditional one.

The banking system is highly complex, complicated and intertwined, it is difficult to model, and constantly changing. Making the right decisions is impossible. 

- Challanges in monetary policy 
    - Quality of data (act before quality data is retrieved and analysed)
    - Timing (actions take time to affect the economy (6-18 months), situation might have changed when policy takes effect)
    - Control? 

Few people at the time understood how large the shadown banking system was and how tied it was to the housing market. Bubbles are much easier to see in hignsight not in realtime. The FED has the power to regulate banks, and could have used to to reduce subprime lending, 

The tools that CBs have are limited and affect the entire economy. Applying these tools as responsens to what is happening in parts of the economy will have consequences for the entire economy. More granular tools that can affect these parts should probably be applied, such as increased regulation, quantitative easing(?), and lending? Oooo, lending to specific topics/industries. 

FED options
- Moneyary discretion (The current)
- Monetary rule (Suggested)
Martin Freedman a rule where M1 or M2 grow at a constant rate (ex 3\% similar to gdp). Rules works best when V is constant. But in crisis, V goes down. 
Other economist
- Target nominal GDP: (M+V) growing at a constant rate. 

In 2008, the FED doubled the MB in 4 months. 

Monetary policy from central banks. Fiscal policy from governments. 

Because the majority of the tools the governemnt and CBs have available affect the entire economy, these tools should not be used to address positive or negative shocks in specific markets, entities (banks), or x. The goals of the tools such as interest rate, should be to influence and stabilize the entire economy, and other tools should be put to influence and stabilize specifics. The general goal should maybe be then to target nominal GDP growth by keeping the growth rate of M+V in QTM constant. In DDA systems we have to possibility to directly log V and make algortihimc adjustment based on this value. If the system has the ability to expand or reduce M in response to V to keep the sum constant then you could achieve this. However, people will may have the ability to manipulate V. So this is maybe not a good idea. In addtion, economic theory states that V is relativly constant, aka the growth rate of V is 0. Temporary changes in V bounce back to the baseline with time. If V is 0, then M should equal nominal GDP. Nominal GDP is probably 3%. So M (money supply) should increase by 3%. You could make a system where M react to V, altough great care should be put in the design of such a system. 

The limits of fiscal policy. An ideal stimulus 
- timely
- targeted 
- and temporary. 

- Recognition lag
- Legislation lag
- Implementation lag
- Effectivness lag (Takes time for governemnt spending to ripple trough the economy)
- Solution: Automatic fiscal policy 
    - For example by automaticly lowering tax rate, when indicators fall
    - welfare and unemployement insurance (timley and targeted)

Should create a simulation and work on an model of the economy based on emperical evidence and analytic reasoning. A model on the global scale that also includes countries and unions (and later planets :D). This model can be evaluated against evidence and adjusted as the economy changes (as it does).
Then create simulations and specific models on top of this to perform research.
Does something like this exist?

Money creation in the modern economy, by bank of england:
"
(Money Supply?)
- This article explains how the majority of money in the modern economy is created by commercial 
banks making loans. 
- Money creation in practice differs from some popular misconceptions — banks do not act simply 
as intermediaries, lending out deposits that savers place with them, and nor do they ‘multiply up’ 
central bank money to create new loans and deposits. 
- The amount of money created in the economy ultimately depends on the monetary policy of the 
central bank. In normal times, this is carried out by setting interest rates. The central bank can 
also affect the amount of money directly through purchasing assets or ‘quantitative easing’. 
"

"The bank of england aims to make sure the amount of money creation in the economy is consistent with low and stable inflation. In normal times, the Bank of England implements monetary policy by setting the interest rate on central bank reserves. This then influences a range of in terest rates in the economy, including those on bank loans."

"Quantitative Easing" is inended to boost the amount of money in the economy directly by purchasing assets, mainly from nonbank financial companies. 

in the modern economy, commercial banks are 
the creators of deposit money. This article explains how, 
rather than banks lending out deposits that are placed with 
them, the act of lending creates deposits — the reverse of the 
sequence typically described in textbooks.(3)

C: However, when new loans are deposited at a bank, the banks depoists will increase, allowing them to lend out more money... So shouldnt the money multiplier effect still hold?

A term-locked deposit is turned into a loan, that is spent, and the reciever deposits the money into a term-locked deposit, where it can be loaned out again. So a term-locked deposit still is FRB, but probably better because it lowers the risk of bank-runs... To make it 100RB. term-locked deposits cant exist. To funds for new loans should then come from equity or bonds. Aka if the customer wants extra risk and profit (interest) on their deposit, they must buy a bond. This bond could theoretically be used for payments... Or it can be sold for tokens if the customer wants to withdraw/use the money.  

Giving a decentralized system discretionary power is very complex and would invovle a proper DAO, voting system, management board etc etc. Rule-based power is easy to implement
