\begin{abstract}
    Inspired by recent events, for example, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank due to a bank run, I want to analyse the current economic system and research improvements or alternatives based on the digital asset economy and technology with the following initial problem statement:

    A 100\% Reserve Banking system, to which digital assets (may) belong, can address many of the critical issues in our current fractional reserve banking system by separating bank deposits from credit (loans). The main concern is that such a system could hinder credit creation and economic growth, leading to a lack of research. The question to consider is: How can a digital asset-based system facilitate credit creation, economic growth, and monetary stability at a level comparable to our existing fractional reserve banking system? 
    
    A specific initial idea can be explored in the file brainstorming.md, but more research must be performed before the problem statement can be transformed into a specific idea.
